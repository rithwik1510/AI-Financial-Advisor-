# Project: AI Financial Advisor (Gemini-powered)

## Goal
- Web app that parses financial statements (PDF/CSV)
- AI chatbot gives advice based on spending patterns
- Dashboard with charts & financial health score
- Local parsing + hosted Gemini for Q&A/doc analysis

## Backend (FastAPI)
[ ] Setup FastAPI project
[ ] PDF/CSV parser -> normalized JSON transactions
[ ] Categorization engine (Food, Rent, etc.)
[ ] Analytics engine (monthly totals, savings, health score)
[ ] /ask endpoint -> send analytics + query to Gemini
[ ] Return AI-generated advice

## Frontend (React + Tailwind)
[ ] Chat UI (like ChatGPT)
[ ] File upload (PDF/CSV)
[ ] Dashboard with:
      - Pie chart (spending by category)
      - Line chart (monthly trends)
      - Financial health score

## Privacy
[ ] Parsing and analytics local
[ ] Only analytics summaries + question (or attached docs for `/ask/docs`) go to Gemini
[ ] Temporary local storage only
[ ] Banner: "Your files stay local; questions go to Gemini"

## Final Polish
[ ] Goal planner (target savings simulation)
[ ] Purchase feasibility (loan/EMI check)
[ ] README + demo video
[ ] Push to GitHub
